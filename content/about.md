**Tash Naved** is a comedian/producer based out of Ontario, Canada who has been "_in the game"_ since 2013. He finds lying about himself online in third person excruciating and prefers that you hear him lie about himself in person.

You can catch him in Ottawa regularly [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/comedy-ottawa-10826961900 "eventbrite").
